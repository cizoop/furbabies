  <h1>"In Karma-yoga no effort is ever lost, and there is no harm." - Bhagavad Gita</h1>
  <p>🐾 Our organization was founded on a simple belief — that every animal deserves safety, care, and compassion. Across our communities, countless stray animals struggle to survive each day without proper food, shelter, or medical attention. Witnessing this suffering inspired us to take action.What began as a small group of volunteers feeding and rescuing stray animals has grown into a dedicated organization focused on rescue, rehabilitation, and rehoming. We work tirelessly to provide medical treatment, foster care, and permanent homes for abandoned and neglected animals.
Beyond rescue, we strive to create lasting change through community education and outreach programs that promote responsible pet ownership and the importance of spaying and neutering.
Our mission is to give every animal a second chance — and to build a community where compassion leads the way. Together, we can end the cycle of neglect and ensure that no animal is ever forgotten.</p>
